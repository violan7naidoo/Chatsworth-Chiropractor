												<h3>Back Pain</h3>
												<p>
													Back pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide, hence it is
													vital to know how to prevent back problems. Ways to maintain good
													back health include:
												</p>

												<li>Healthy diet and weight maintenance</li>
												<li>Remaining active and avoiding prolonged inactivity or bed rest
												</li>
												<li>Before doing exercises or any physical activity, warm up and
													stretch is recommended.</li>
												<li>Proper posture, wear comfortable, low-heeled shoes and sleep on
													a mattress of medium firmness to minimize any curvature in your
													spine.</li>
												<li>It is always good to remember to lift with your knees, do not
													twist when lifting and keep objects close to your body.</li>
												<li>Ensure your working space is ergonomically correct</li>

												<p>
													Spinal manipulation and chiropractic care are generally considered
													safe, effective treatments for acute and chronic back pain.

												<h3>Neck Pain</h3>
												<p>
													The neck’s susceptibility to pain and injury is due in part to
													biomechanics and its flexibility. Activities and events that affect
													cervical spine biomechanics include extended sitting, repetitive
													movement, accidents, head injuries and normal aging.<br>
													A neck adjustment (also known as cervical manipulation) is a precise
													procedure where pressure is applied to the joints of the neck,
													usually by hand. A neck adjustment works to improve the mobility of
													the spine and to restore range of motion. Patients typically notice
													an improved ability to turn and tilt the head as well as a reduction
													of pain, soreness and stiffness.

												<h3>Headaches</h3>
												<p>
													Most headaches are tension, migraine, or cluster
													headaches. <br>Chiropractic care can assist you by performing spinal
													manipulation or adjustments that improve spinal function to
													alleviate mechanical stress. Massage therapy will reduce stress and
													anxiety, relax muscles, rehabilitate injuries, reduce pain and
													promote overall health and wellness. We also offer advice on your
													posture, diet, exercises, and relaxation techniques. This can assist
													you in relieving tension in the muscles of your neck and upper back.

												<h3>Sports Injury Assessment and Rehabilitation</h3>
												<p>
													There are a number of ways in which a soft tissue sports injury can
													occur: Muscle strain – when the muscle or tendon is pulled too far
													in one direction Contusions – resulting from a direct blow to the
													muscle/tissue Tendonitis – when the tendon becomes overstressed and
													inflamed Ligament Sprains – when the ligament is stretched beyond
													its normal range.
													<br>
													We have been trained with an extensive knowledge of sports and
													sports-related injuries. Treatment of sports injuries includes
													widely used physical (ice/dry needling/strapping) and massage
													therapies. These techniques can help athletes return to training and
													perform at their peak level sooner.

												<h3>Weight loss programme</h3>
												<p>
													Obesity is not only a chronic disease in itself, but also a major
													risk factor for the world’s leading causes of poor health and early
													death including cardiovascular disease, several common cancers,
													diabetes and osteoarthritis.
													<br>
													There is no denying that it’s tough to lose weight. There are many
													confounding variables like current weight, age, sex, metabolism,
													genetics and medical conditions. It can be difficult to figure out
													which route will work best for you, especially when there are
													literally thousands of diets, workout plans, supplements, protein
													shakes and meal plans out there to choose from.
													<br>
													Even once you decide on your plan of action, you may find that at a
													certain point, no matter what you do, you have hit a plateau in your
													weight loss.
													<br>
													We specialise in aiding your weight loss with a comprehensive,
													personalised plan by offering nutritional and exercise advice that
													works.

												<h3>Chronic Disease Management</h3>
												<p>
													Seeking chiropractic care to holistically manage chronic disease is
													a great option for supporting the body’s natural healing abilities
													and function.

													<br>
													Chiropractic care can be helpful for a variety of chronic, or
													long-lasting, medical conditions. These include non-orthopaedic
													chronic medical conditions – like diabetes, heart disease, mental
													illness, lung disease and arthritis.

													<br>
													We offer health screenings for various conditions including
													diabetes, hypertension and metabolic syndrome.
													<br>

													Chiropractic treatments are generally safe, even for patients with
													chronic illnesses.

												<h3>Arthritis</h3>
												<p>
													Arthritis is usually associated with pain, swelling, and reduced
													range of motion in the affected joint. Arthritis is a general term
													that affects your joint health, and living with it can be extremely
													frustrating and debilitating. Symptoms often begin as mild pain that
													gradually increases in severity over time. Regardless of the type of
													arthritis (osteoarthritis/rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic
													arthritis) you are suffering from, the pain can be overwhelming.

													<br>
													Chiropractic care has been known to slow down or even stop the
													progression of arthritis. Not only will you see the benefits in a
													decrease of pain, but you will also see an improvement in your
													overall health and movement.

												<h3>Other musculoskeletal conditions</h3>
												<p>
													We specialise in treatment of myofascial pain syndrome/fibromyalgia.
													Symptoms of this syndrome typically involve the muscle or a muscle
													situated near a joint that is especially painful. Over time, pain
													can spread to other areas. Trigger points are tightened,
													hypersensitive spots that can be located in any muscle.

													</n>
													One of the best forms of chiropractic therapies for myofascial pain
													syndrome is myofascial release therapy.

													<br>
													Trigger point therapy is effective at addressing muscle knots and
													areas where the muscle has been strained or torn. Through the
													targeted pressure applied, blood flow is increased to these areas,
													promoting and accelerating the healing process.

													<br>
													Other therapies include spinal manipulation and dry needling.

												<h3>Back Pain</h3>
												
												<p>
													Back pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide, hence it is
													vital to know how to prevent back problems. Ways to maintain good
													back health include:
												</p>

												<li>Healthy diet and weight maintenance</li>
												<li>Remaining active and avoiding prolonged inactivity or bed rest
												</li>
												<li>Before doing exercises or any physical activity, warm up and
													stretch is recommended.</li>
												<li>Proper posture, wear comfortable, low-heeled shoes and sleep on
													a mattress of medium firmness to minimize any curvature in your
													spine.</li>
												<li>It is always good to remember to lift with your knees, do not
													twist when lifting and keep objects close to your body.</li>
												<li>Ensure your working space is ergonomically correct</li>

												<p>
													Spinal manipulation and chiropractic care are generally considered
													safe, effective treatments for acute and chronic back pain.
